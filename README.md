## Overview
### Description
A quiz app that asks you multiple-choice questions related to computer science interview questions. Algorithms and data structures based. (also include a section that displays different languages of code and asks the user to pick out which language it is) (section with bugs in code with error messages that user needs to fix) - All should be multiple-choice, otherwise it would be too difficult.

## Product Spec

* Database for the questions. Either need to get an API, or write the questions ourselves.
* QuizActivity.xml - Should have a question at the top, and 4 buttons representing each multiple choice. Should probably also have an exit button. Point counter gained per quiz. We could probably follow the same pt system as some online quiz thing. 
* Home.xml - buttons to represent the different quiz types. Username at the top left. Points at the top right.
